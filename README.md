# Assessment Tool

This repository contains the standalone HTML assessment tool along with regression tests that exercise the consolidation workflow.

## Tests

Run the Node-based regression checks to ensure consolidation behaviour and the absence of legacy MOS/THI references:

```bash
node tests/consolidation.test.js
```
